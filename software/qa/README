sample capture files

 most are captured once with an edge trigger (NAME_trig.sr) and once without one.


10ms_30kHz.sr
10ms_30kHz_trig.sr

  notes:
    non-triggered file has at least 1 blackout error for each simulated divider.
    triggered file replayed correctly with 0.0011us avg err using div 1.

10ms_35kHz.sr
10ms_35kHz_trig.sr

  notes:
    non-triggered file has at least 2 blackout errors for each simulated divider.
    triggered file replayed correctly with 0.0009usus avg err using div 1.


1m_10Hz.sr
1m_10Hz_trig.sr

    notes:
        replayed correctly using any div, 1 preferred

1s_10Hz.sr
1s_10Hz_trig.sr

    notes:
        replayed correctly using any div, 1 preferred

20s_100mHz.sr
20s_100mHz_trig.sr

    notes:
        div 16 ends up as the preferred timer clock divider due to the 1us sampling interval of the input file

20s_1Hz.sr
20s_1Hz_trig.sr

    notes:
        div 1 is preferred probably due to a small inacuracy of the 'double' representation.
        !need to look closer!

2s_10Hz.sr
2s_10Hz_trig.sr

    notes:
        div 1 is preferred probably due to a small inacuracy of the 'double' representation.
        !need to look closer!

3m_100mHz.sr
3m_100mHz_trig.sr

    notes:
        div 64 is preferred, with 781 packets. div 1 would have had 48856 packets.

i2c_slow.sr

    notes:
        div 64 is preferred.

test_slow.sr

    notes:
        div 1 is preferred.
