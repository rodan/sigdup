linux-based test suite for the zmodem functionality

zmodem_unit_test.sh
  is a script that can verify file transfer with a customizable number of iterations. you'll need 'lsz' from the lrsz package for it to work.
  -n generates TEST_ITER number of random binary files and transfers them via 'rz'
  -e retries the transfer of already generated files
    the script stops at the first transfer error it encounters. 'caught signal 13' errors can be ignored - it happens if 'rz' closes the pipe before 'lsz' does. 

make

  generates the rz binary that can be tested with the enclosed zmodem_unit_test.sh

make cppcheck

  runs Cppcheck static code analysis

make scan-build

  runs LLVM's static code analyzer


this zmodem implementation has been tested and found to work well with lrzsz, zoc and teraterm.
