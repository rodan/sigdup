* Compiling the project

option 1:
the toolchain used for this project is provided by TI [1]. the rest of the tools needed by the Makefile in order to compile the project are readily available in most Linux distributions.
make sure to 'git clone' the msp430 reference libraries [2] (or provide a symlink to them) to /opt/reference_libs_msp430

use the following commands:

 ln -s "/FIXTHIS/reference_libs_msp430" /opt/reference_libs_msp430

 make
    builds the entire project with the MSP430FR5994 target. all the resulting objects and the elf binary will be inside the './build/MSP430FR5994' subdirectory

 make install
    takes ./build/MSP430F5510/main.elf and tries to flash it. this needs the mspdebug application, an ezfet-1.2 or msp-fet programmer connected to the target board.

 make scan-build
    optional static scan provided by Clang (if installed)

 make cppcheck
    optional static scan provided by Cppcheck (if installed)


option 2:
install Code Composer Studio under Linux and Import the project found in this directory.
compilation and debug happens as with any other CCS project, but be adivsed that only the gcc compiler is currently supported.

no support for windows-based conpilation is provided.
