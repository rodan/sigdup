 pc application:
  - import the pulseview-generated data and convert it into a 'dup' file containing channel states and timing information

 microcontroller:
  - zmodem implementation for the transfer of the dup file from pc
  - read/write dup info into HIFRAM (0x00010000 - 0x00043FF7)
  - scheduling of signal transitions based on the dup file
